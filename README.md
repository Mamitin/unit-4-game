# Crystal Collector

## Overveiw:
This homework assignment was to create a fun and interactive game for web browsers that dynamically updates my HTML pages with the jQuery library.

## How to play the game?
- There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
- The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
- When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
- The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
- When the player clicks a crystal, the app updates the player's score counter.
- The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
- The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
- The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
- When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values.
- The app will show the number of games the player wins and loses.
